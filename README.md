# Usage
## Start the System
Power on the PLC and HMI.
Launch the SCADA system on the designated computer.
## Monitor and Control
Use the HMI to view real-time data on air pressure, flow rates, and usage.
Adjust control parameters as needed through the HMI.
## Maintenance
Regularly check sensors and actuators for proper operation.
Calibrate sensors periodically to ensure accurate readings.
Use the leak detection feature to identify and repair any leaks promptly.
# risk management
## Technical Risks
## project risk
## user risk
User risks include resistance to change, insufficient training, and system misuse. To address these, engage users early by highlighting the system's benefits and involve them in design and testing. Provide comprehensive training and support materials to ensure users understand the system. Implement a user-friendly interface with error prevention features and strict access controls. Balance automation with manual checks and offer regular feedback channels to address user concerns promptly. Regularly review and update the system based on user feedback and performance metrics to enhance user satisfaction and effectiveness.
