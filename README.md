# Usage
## Start the System
Power on the PLC and HMI.
Launch the SCADA system on the designated computer.
## Monitor and Control
Use the HMI to view real-time data on air pressure, flow rates, and usage.
Adjust control parameters as needed through the HMI.
## Maintenance
Regularly check sensors and actuators for proper operation.
Calibrate sensors periodically to ensure accurate readings.
Use the leak detection feature to identify and repair any leaks promptly.
